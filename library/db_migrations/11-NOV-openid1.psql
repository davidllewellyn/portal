; For openid functionality we need to keep track of the associations that are created.
CREATE TABLE openid_associations (
   uuid            UUID            NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,
   assoc_type      TEXT            NOT NULL,
   session_type    TEXT            NOT NULL,
   mac_key         TEXT            NOT NULL,
   timestamp       TIMESTAMP       NOT NULL
);            

GRANT ALL ON openid_associations TO www,sysadmin;
